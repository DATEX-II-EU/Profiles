Profile information
Normal 0 false false false SV X-NONE X-NONE

ASFINAG provides DATEX II traffic information of Austrian motorways for service providers and other interested institutions. This profile describes the message content for the toll roads (i.e. in this case roads of Austria which are charged in addition to the motorway-vignette).

This profile contains a Level B extension for the Toll Publication.

A toll booth will be referenced by a Point location. The charged road can be referenced with their length (according to this point) or by a Linear Object. The description of these standard location referencing methods is not included in this document.

ASFINAG specific documentation (for example the basis of computation) is accentuated in colour.
