Profile information
ASFINAG provides DATEX II traffic information of Austrian motorways for service providers and other interested institutions. This profile describes the message content for the Static Part of Intelligent Truck Parking. It is limited to elements that are specified in the corresponding EU Regulation 885/2013 (including a very little set of further optional elements that make the profile smoothly) as well as some more optional elements selected by ASFINAG. The DATEX standard location referencing methods are not included in this document. ASFINAG specific documentation is accentuated in colour.
All documents including those for dynamic information can be found in the zip-file.
