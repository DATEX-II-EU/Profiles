Organization description
By building, managing and maintaining the motorways and expressways of Slovenia, we connect the country and provide our users with a safe and comfortable mobility. We take various measures to guarantee road safety and ensure an uninterrupted traffic flow on the motorway network. Special emphasis is given to raising awareness about a safe and tolerant driving style among users and the general public, as well as regular and timely reports on traffic conditions.

We monitor and manage motorway and expressway traffic 24/7, cooperating with the neighbouring countries. We strive to improve traffic safety. With the help of Traffic information centre, we inform users of the motorway network and state roads about the traffic conditions.
