Profile information
Magyar Közút (Hungarian Public Roads) provides DATEX II traffic data of the Hungarian national road network for service providers to be distributed to road users.

This document describes the Hungarian planned and unplanned events. Events cover a wide range of event types that potentially cause short-term and long-term disruptions to traffic. The goal of this profile documentation is to have a better understanding of our data usage, structure, and point of view.

Planned events include construction and maintenance works, public events, disturbance activities and lane or carriageway management actions carried out by Magyar Közút. This profile uses DATEX II SituationPublication and is fit for DATEX II version 2.3.
