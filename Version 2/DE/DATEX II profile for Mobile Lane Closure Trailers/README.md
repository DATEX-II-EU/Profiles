Profile information
Mobile Lane Closure Trailors are used to inidicate road works or road maintenance, lane closures or road closures.

This DATEX II profile can be used to transfer information from Mobile Lane Closure Trailers from central to central, for example from some service provider to some management system. Usually the data is generated inside the trailer system itself and collected by a service provider.

This profile can be especially uesful for short term events, in which the situation cannot be scheduled in advance. The information can be subject to change, for instance the position (moving road maintenance) or the signals and symbols displayed to the drivers. Therefore it is possible to transfer the data at a high frequency.
