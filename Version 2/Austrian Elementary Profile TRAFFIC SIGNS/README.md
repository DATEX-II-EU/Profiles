Profile information
ASFINAG provides DATEX II  traffic data feeds in real time with 24/7/365 availability of all Austrian highways and motorways. Principal contractors for the data would be service providers for mobile transmission to vehicles.

Austria promotes the idea of Elementary Profiles to be provided in the same form by every EU member starte. Any necessary filtering or aggregation would be performed by the contractor.

This section describes the Austrian  Elementary Profile "Traffic Signs". It consists of two feeds, "Traffic Signs Static" for the location of the traffic signs, and "Traffic Signs Dynamic" for the content of the traffic signs.
