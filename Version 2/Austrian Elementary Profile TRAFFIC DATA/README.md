ASFINAG provides DATEX II traffic information of Austrian motorways for service providers and other interested institutions. This profile describes the message content for Traffic data.

For data delivery the traffic data is split in two DATEX II files: 1. TrafficData_static: This file contains the identifiers of the traffic sensors along with the location information for all traffic sensors in different location referencing methods 2. TrafficData_dynamic: This file contains the identifiers of the traffic sensors along with the actual measurement values of the traffic sensors.
