Extension information
This is an officially released extension from DATEX II PSA run in 2016-2021 dealing with a description of Lane and Carriageway regulations taylored for Dynamic Lane Management and HardShoulder Management Zone implemented by specific static and variable signs.

the Land and Carriageway Model extends the Traffic Regulation package released from the same PSA to manage specific segments, sections and lanes settings according to common understanding usage within mostly motorway operators running such dynamic lane management zones. besides those prefefined zones management the model can be used to describe the restriction to lanes and carriageways in roadworks management with lanes deviated, closed and reversed along a road or motorway segment defined by the roadwork zone.

the implementation had been proposed by DATEX II PSA and will be considered for further evolution in the following year by the prosecution of the DATEX II activities.
