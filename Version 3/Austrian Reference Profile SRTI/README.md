Profile information

ASFINAG provides DATEX II traffic data feeds in real time with 24/7/365 availability of all Austrian highways and motorways. Principal contractors for the data would be service providers for mobile transmission to vehicles. Please visit [https://contentportal.asfinag.at/](https://contentportal.asfinag.at/) for registration and to acquire a contract.

This section describes the Austrian Reference Profile for safety-related traffic information. It uses SituationPublication to describe the content of unplanned events. Location referencing is done using Points and Linear elements in the form of coordinates and ALERT-C. OpenLR location referencing is also supported. It also uses few B level extensions in addition to the approved extensions, which are also documented. One important extension is the “Graph Integration Platform (GIP)”. The GIP provides a digital map of Austria’s transport network to all authorities.
